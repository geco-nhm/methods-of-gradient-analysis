# Example scripts by others

Students and others are welcome to add scripts here that may be of use to others. For example, if you are doing your own analyses with a setup of data that differs from the cases covered by the course, it might be useful for others to see the script as an example. 

**NB! Scripts added here will be visible to the pulic and subject to the same license as the other files (MIT).**

**NB! The scripts in this folder may or may not be checked by course teachers and contain appropriate application of statistical methods. **

## Do you want to contribute a script?

- please add your name as script author inside the script itself
- name your script file something meaningful (e.g. `DCA_NMDS_blocked_presence-absence_data.R`), including method name and something about the data. Please avoid spaces in the file name; use hyphens (-), underscores (_) or camelCase instead.
- upload your file with a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (a request for admin users to pull your changes into the main version of the repository) either in a new branch or from your own fork of the repository.
